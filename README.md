# focused-notes
A simple note-taking app with html and JS: https://paloranta.github.io/focused-notes-demo/
The notes stay on your device. Uses localstorage.

TODO:
- Add markdown parsing. I struggled adding snarkdown as the parser. Managed to do it but there were drawbacks.
- Make it look better.
- Animate saving and deleting.
- Maybe move onto IndexedDB.
